# H.W.A.T. Force
H.W.A.T. Force (Hideous Weapons and Tactics) is an HDest-focused mod to replicate SWAT4's communication macros and spy camera. Currently undergoing bugfixing to become stable

These are addons to go with H.W.A.T. Force. Includes spy camera, chat macros, drop down comms, and ping system.
